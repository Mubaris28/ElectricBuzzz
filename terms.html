                                <h3>ACCEPTANCE OF OUR TERMS</h3>

<p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) constitute a binding contract between you and Electric Buzz, LLC (“us” or “we” or “Electric Buzz”) governing the use of and access to the products and services offered in connection with a paid or trial subscription (“Products” or “Services”) to you and any authorized individuals engaged by you to use the Products on your behalf (each, a “User,” and collectively, “Users”). By using our services, or authorizing us to act on your behalf, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms. <br><br>
If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of a company, organization, or other legal entity (“Entity”), you agree to these Terms for that Entity and represent to Electric Buzz that you have the authority to bind such Entity and its affiliates to these Terms. In such case, “you” or “Customer” shall refer to such Entity and its affiliates. If you are a Customer’s User, then these Terms will apply to you to the extent they are applicable to Users. If Customer is an agency, then a User may also be an agency client as described in Section 10 (Agencies). If you do not have the authority to bind the Entity to these Terms or do not agree to these Terms, do not accept these Terms.<br><br>

You represent and warrant that the information you provide in registering and onboarding  is accurate, complete, and rightfully yours to use.<p>

<h3>PAYMENT TERMS</h3>

<p> You will either pay for your Plan in our Application, or upon receipt of an invoice issued by us.<p>

<h3>Payment for Legacy, Monthly Plans</h3>

<p> Monthly Plans. For monthly Plans, we will charge you on the first day of your subscription term and automatically on the same date of each subsequent month (“Monthly Pay Date”). We will continue to charge you for your Plan, including any Add-Ons, on a monthly basis until the plan is changed or canceled. If you cancel during the subscription term, you will not be issued any refunds or credits of any prepaid and unused fees for the remainder of the subscription term and you will continue to have access to the services for the remainder of the term. </p>

<h3>Payment in for contracted terms or purchase orders</h3>

<p> For annual plans, contracted terms, and purchase orders, we will charge you on the first day of your subscription term and automatically on the same date of each subsequent month, quarter, or year (“Pay Date”) as specified in your contract or purchase order. We will continue to charge you for your Plan, including any Add-Ons, on this reoccurring basis unless you decide to cancel during the “notice period” specified in your contract, invoice, or purchase order. You can do this by contacting your account manager or emailing info@electricbuzz.agency. If you cancel during the subscription term, you will not be issued any refunds or credits of any prepaid and unused fees for the remainder of the contracted term and you will continue to have access to the services until the end of the currently <br>  <br> 
contracted or purchased period.</p>

<h3>Payment By Invoice</h3>
<p> If we invoice you for your Plan, your subscription term will be detailed on the service order and your payment will be due upon receipt of the applicable invoice. Unless otherwise specified on your service order, if we do not receive payment within thirty (30) days of us issuing you the invoice, your account may be suspended, you will lose access to the services, and any unpaid fees will be sent to collections or remitted by a court order. Unless otherwise specified on your service order, your Plan will automatically renew at the end of the subscription term. If you would like to cancel your Plan, you must provide such notice via email to your account manager and comply with the cancellation terms.</p>

<h3>Changes To Your Plan</h3>

<p> If you choose to upgrade your Plan or add any Add-Ons to your Plan during your subscription term, you will be charged for the then-current price for the upgrade or Add-Ons prorated based on the number of days remaining in your subscription term. Unless otherwise specified on your service order, any upgrade or Add-Ons that you add will be coterminous with the existing Plan and automatically renew at the end of the subscription term along with your Plan. If you choose to downgrade your Plan or remove any Add-Ons from your Plan, you will not be issued any refunds or credits for the unused and prepaid fees in connection with the downgrade or removal. In-kind, you must comply with the cancellation terms. Downgrading your Plan may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of your account and we do <br><br>
not accept any liability for any such loss.</p>

<h3>Credit Card, Stripe, and Payment Authorization</h3>

<p> By submitting your credit card or Payment information to Electric Buzz, you authorize Electric Buzz to store this information with its third-party service providers and to charge the credit card or payment method you have provided to us until your account is terminated and all fees collected. In addition, you authorize us to use a third-party payment processor in processing payments. If your credit card expires, or is declined or your payment information requires an update, we will provide you notice via email. If for any reason, your payment cannot be completed through credit card or Paypal, we may suspend your services until we receive payment and all unpaid fees will be sent to collections or remitted via court order. </p>

<h3>Disputes and Late Payments</h3>

<p> You must notify us in writing of any amounts you wish to dispute prior to the date such amounts would otherwise be due. Any undisputed amount not paid when due shall be subject to a finance charge of 5% of the unpaid balance per month or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, determined and compounded monthly from the date due until the date paid. You will also be required to reimburse us for any costs or expenses (including any reasonable attorneys’ fees) we incur to collect past due amounts. Any amounts due under these Terms shall not be withheld or offset by you against amounts due to you for any reason. </p>

<h3>Taxes</h3>

<p> All payments you make are exclusive of federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, duties, tariffs, levies, withholdings, and similar assessments (including, without limitation, sales taxes, use taxes, and value-added taxes). You agree to be responsible for the payment of all such charges, excluding taxes based upon our net income. All amounts payable by you hereunder shall be grossed-up for any withholding taxes imposed by any foreign government on your payment of amounts to Electric Buzz.</p>

<h3>CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION</h3>

<h3>Termination by You</h3>

<p> You may terminate your account GIVEN 30 DAYS (“notice period”) that you will be canceling services. Meaning, you will provide 30 days notice that you intend to cancel at which time the remainder of your current service term will run its due course without further renewal after the notice period is over. Example: If for instance the date is March 15th and your service term renews on March 20th, and you inform your account manager you wish to end services. Your service term will still end on April 16th and you will owe the prorated amount.<br><br>

EQUALLY, there isn’t a “grace period”. Meaning, if formal written notice is given on the  30th day (29 or fewer days from the service renewal date), the service term would renew again as scheduled.<br><br>

Termination must be given in writing to your account manager and payment for the final month (transition phase) must be made at the same schedule as in previous months. You will not be entitled to any refunds of any prepaid and unused fees, and any unpaid fees under your Plan for the applicable subscription term will become immediately due and payable.</p>

<h3>Termination by Us</h3>

<p> We may restrict the functionality of the services or temporarily suspend your account if we reasonably believe that you have violated these Terms. Unless we believe the need to restrict or suspend service is time-sensitive and requires immediate action without notice, or we are prohibited from providing notice under law or legal order, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you by email prior to such suspension. We will not be liable to you or any third parties for any of the foregoing actions.<br><br>

We may terminate your services for any of the following reasons: (i) you fail to comply with these Terms, (ii) you do not pay your fees in accordance with the payment terms under your Plan, (iii) at the expiration of the subscription period of your Plan if we provide prior written notice to you, (iv) you become the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (v) if we determine you are acting or have acted in a way that negatively impacts or reflects on Electric Buzz or our current or prospective partners or customers.<br><br>

In no event will any termination by us for the foregoing reasons entitle you to any refunds of any prepaid and unused fees or relieve you of your obligation to pay any fees payable to us prior to the date of termination, and any unpaid fees under your Plan will become immediately due and payable. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, hateful, discriminatory or illegal activity may be grounds for immediate termination of your use of the service and may be referred to law enforcement authorities.</p>

<h3>Post Termination</h3>

<p> If your account is terminated, Electric Buzz reserves the right to delete any Content on our systems with no liability or notice to you. Once your Content is deleted, you will not be able to recover such Content, except any Content that remains on Third Party Services pursuant to the terms and conditions of such Third-Party Services.</p>

<h3>Failure to Defend</h3>

<p> If the Indemnifier does not to assume the defense against the claim or action then the Indemnitee may defend against the claim or action in any manner the Indemnitee deems appropriate.

<h3>Settlement and Consent of Indemnifier</h3>

<p> The Indemnitee will not settle any claim or action without first obtaining the written consent of the Indemnifier.

<h3>Expenses</h3>

<p> No costs, charges or Expenses for which indemnity will be sought under this Agreement may be incurred without the Indemnifier’s written consent. Any required consent must not be unreasonably withheld.<br><br>

<h3>Advances of Expenses</h3>

<p> At the written request of the Indemnitee, the Indemnifier will advance to the Indemnitee any Expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the Indemnitee in defending any action brought against the Indemnitee. Where reasonable, and to minimize hardship to the Indemnitee, advance payments may be made prior to the disposition of any claim.<br><br>

The Indemnitee agrees to repay to the Indemnifier any advance payments on Expenses where a determination is ultimately made that the Indemnitee’s behavior is not entitled to indemnification for reasons described under the Exceptions to Indemnification section.</p>

<h3>Insurance</h3>

<p> The Indemnifier must take out and maintain insurance coverage with an insurer reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee on terms reasonable and sufficient to indemnify the participation of the Indemnitee in the Activity.<br><br>

<p> Although you are not required to provide feedback or suggestions, you assign to us all of your worldwide right, title and interest in and to any and all feedback, suggestions, requests, recommendations, or other comments that you provide to us regarding our Products, including all Intellectual Property Rights therein. You shall, upon the request of Electric Buzz, its successors or assigns, execute any and all documents that may be deemed necessary to effectuate this assignment. You also agree to waive any right of approval for our use of the rights granted herein and agree to waive any moral rights that you may have in any feedback, suggestions, or other comments, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you.

Our receipt of your feedback, suggestions, and other comments is not an admission of their novelty, priority, or originality, and it does not impair our right to any existing or future Intellectual Property Rights.</p>

<h3>Non-Disparagement</h3>

<p> Client shall not, at any time during the Term and thereafter, make statements or representations, or otherwise communicate, directly or indirectly, in writing, orally, or otherwise, or take any action which may, directly or indirectly, disparage Electric Buzz or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees, advisors, businesses or reputations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Client from making statements that are required by court order, regulation or legal process.

<h3>Non-Solicitation</h3>

<p> Any attempt on the part of the client to induce others to leave the employ, or any effort by the client to interfere with Electric Buzz’ employees and third parties would be harmful and damaging. Both parties agree that from the date of this Agreement and for two years after, the client will not in any way, directly or indirectly:

-induce or attempt to induce any employee or third party of Electric Buzz to quit their employment or retainer;

-otherwise interfere with or disrupt relationships with the employees of Electric Buzz;

-discuss employment opportunities or provide information about competitive employment to any employees of Electric Buzz; or

-solicit, entice, or hire away any employee of Electric Buzz’.

-This obligation will be limited in scope to those persons that were employees or  contractors of Electric Buzz at the same time that Electric Buzz and the Client were retained by each other or worked together.</p>

<h3>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>

<p> Exclusion of Consequential and Related Damages. NEITHER PARTY NOR ITS AFFILIATES WILL, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY, UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, INCLUDING BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, ENHANCED, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, BUSINESS, OR DATA; BUSINESS INTERRUPTION; OR LOSS OF GOODWILL OR REPUTATION, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PARTY IS APPRISED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES OCCURRING OR ANY LOSSES OR DAMAGES WERE OTHERWISE FORESEEABLE.<br><br>

Monetary Cap on Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF ELECTRIC BUZZ AND OUR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTY CLAIMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO ELECTRIC BUZZ UNDER THE APPLICABLE PLAN DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL NOT IN ANY WAY LIMIT YOUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 4 ABOVE. THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY PROVIDED FOR HEREIN WILL APPLY IN AGGREGATE TO YOU AND YOUR AFFILIATES AND SHALL NOT BE CUMULATIVE.<br>

Independent Allocations of Risk. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES  IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN THE PRICING OFFERED BY ELECTRIC BUZZ TO YOU AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY.<br><br>

State Prohibition of Limitation of Liability and Disclaimer of Implied Warranties. Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. IN THESE STATES, EACH PARTY’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

<h3>Use of Logo</h3>

<p> As a Customer, you grant us the right to use your company name and logo on our representative customer list on our website and/or marketing materials. If you do not wish to have your name or logo be used in this way, or wish to remove your name or logo from such list, please email your account manager.</p>

<h3>Updates To Terms</h3>

<p> We may revise and update these Terms from time to time, in our sole discretion. Any changes we make to these Terms are effective immediately when we post them. We will provide notice to the account owner designated on the account of any material changes. Continued use of our Products after we provide you notice of the updated Terms shall constitute acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

<h3>Assignability</h3>

<p> Neither party may assign its right, duties, and obligations under these Terms without the other party’s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that Electric Buzz may assign these Terms, and the licenses granted to Electric Buzz under these Terms, without your consent to a successor (including a successor by way of merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or operation of law) if the successor agrees to assume and fulfill all of Electric Buzz’ obligations under these Terms.</p>

<h3>Notices</h3>

<p> Except as otherwise specified in these terms, any notices under these Terms must be sent to Electric Buzz by email to your account manager, with a duplicate copy sent via registered mail (return receipt requested) to: Electric Buzz, LLC, Attention: Legal Department; 12195 Highway 92, Suite 114-444, Woodstock, Ga 30188. Any notices under these Terms that are sent to you shall be sent via email to the named account owner of your Electric Buzz account. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the email address and other contact information of your named account owner.</p>

<h3>Force Majeure</h3>

<p> Neither party will be liable for, or be considered to be in breach of or default under these Terms on account of, any delay or failure to perform as required by these Terms as a result of any cause or condition beyond its reasonable control, so long as that party uses commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove the causes of non-performance.</p>

<h3>Governing Law</h3>

<p> These Terms will be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance with the local laws of the State of Georgia, U.S.A., without reference to its choice of law rules and not including the provisions of the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</p>

<h3>Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes</h3>

<p> You and Electric Buzz agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, except to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate Electric Buzz’ Intellectual Property Rights. Under such limited circumstances, Electric Buzz may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Products, or intellectual property infringement without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described herein. In all other cases, both parties hereby agree to submit to arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rule with one (1) arbitrator to be selected by mutual agreement of the parties. If we cannot agree on the arbitrator selection, then the American Arbitration Association shall choose an arbitrator for us from the National Panel of Arbitrators. You agree that an arbitrator cannot award punitive damages to either party and to abide by and perform any award rendered by the arbitrator. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, which shall include, but not be limited to, the courts within Cherokee County, Georgia.</p>

<h3>Waiver and Severability.</h3>

<p> The waiver by Electric Buzz of any term or condition set out in these Terms shall not be deemed a further or continuing waiver of any other provision of these Terms, and any failure of Electric Buzz to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal for any reason, such provision shall be limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue in full force and effect.</p>

<h3>Entire Agreement.</h3>

<p> Except for any service order, these Terms are the final and complete expression of the agreement between these parties regarding your use of the Products and Application. These Terms supersede, and the terms of these Terms govern, all previous oral and written communications regarding these matters, all of which are merged into these Terms. Electric Buzz will not be bound by, and specifically objects to, any term, condition, or other provision that is different from or in addition to these Terms (whether or not it would materially alter this agreement) that is proffered by you in any receipt, invoice, acceptance, purchase order, confirmation, correspondence, or otherwise, regardless of Electric Buzz’ failure to object to such terms, provisions or conditions.<br> <br>

Relationship; Independent Contractor. Nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to constitute the parties as principal and agent, employer and employee, partners or joint venturers, nor shall any similar relationship be deemed to exist between the parties. Neither party shall have any power to obligate or bind the other party, except as specifically provided herein.</p>

<h3>General Provisions</h3>

<p> This Agreement contains all terms and conditions agreed to by the Indemnifier and the Indemnitee. Statements or representations which may have been made by either Party in the negotiation stages of this Agreement may in some way be inconsistent with this final written Agreement. All such statements are declared to be of no value to either Party. Only the written terms of this Agreement will bind the Parties. <br><br>

Any failure of either Party to enforce any of the terms, covenants and conditions in this Agreement does not infer or permit a further waiver of that or any other right or benefit under this Agreement. A waiver by one Party of any right or benefit provided in this Agreement does not infer or permit a further waiver of that right or benefit, nor does it infer or permit a waiver of any other right or benefit provided in this Agreement. <br><br>

This Agreement will pass to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties’ respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and permitted assigns. <br><br>

The clauses, paragraphs, and subparagraphs contained in this Agreement are intended to be read and construed independently of each other. If any part of this Agreement is held to be invalid, this invalidity will not affect the operation of any other part of this Agreement. <br><br>

All of the rights, remedies and benefits provided in this Agreement will be cumulative and will not be exclusive of any other such rights, remedies and benefits allowed by law or equity that the Parties may have now or may acquire in the future.</p>

<h3>Time is of the essence in this Agreement</h3>

<p> This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original and all of which together will be deemed to be one and the same instrument. <br><br>
